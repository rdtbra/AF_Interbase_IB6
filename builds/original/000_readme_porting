1. write prefix.<platform> for builds

2. remote/remote.h: define ARCHITECTURE macro. eg.
             #ifdef IMP
             #define ARCHITECTURE		arch_imp
             #endif

3. remote/protocol.h: define architecture identifier.
   adjusting arch_max as appropriate. eg.
             arch_imp		= 22,
             arch_max		= 23

4. run the align program and use its output to modify common.h

5. set up common.h
    vfork
    SMALL_FILE_NAMES
    SHMEM_PICKY
    ATEXIT
    KILLER_SIGNALS
    SETPGRP

6. jrd/pag.c: define CLASS macro. eg.
             #ifdef IMP
             #define CLASS		2
             #endif

7. jrd/why.c: adjust for subsystems supported. eg.
             #ifdef IMP
             #undef CSI
             #undef PIPE
             #endif

8. jrd/license.h: add platform identifier. eg.
             #ifdef IMP
             #define GDS_VERSION	"IM-I3.3A"
             #endif

9. jrd/utl.c: add implementation literal. eg.
             "InterBase/imp"			/* 44 */

10. jrd/isc.c
   value for MTAB
   how is MTAB processed (ISC_analyse_nfs)
