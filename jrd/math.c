/*
 *      PROGRAM:        JRD Math Floating Point Module
 *      MODULE:         math.c
 *      DESCRIPTION:    These are floating point operations which 
 * 			are explicitly performed outside the module 
 *			in which they are requested. This allows us to
 * 			place a stack switching layer in order to 
 *			guarantee that the EXE stack is in effect at 
 *			the time the floating point operations are 
 *			performed.  This is necessary for the floating 
 *			point co-processor to handle floating point 
 * 			errors correctly (instead of GPFing).
